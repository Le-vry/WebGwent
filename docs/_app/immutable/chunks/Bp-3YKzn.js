If you remember from last time, the card selector works and hasn’t been improved at all since then. However,
The gameboard wasn’t at all playable. Now the gameboard shows up fine and other improvements are as follows:
Each player now get a hand randomly picked out for them from the cards they chose in the card selector.
All unit and hero cards are now placable and four out of seven abilities work.
The remaining card abilities that don’t work are:
Weather and special cards aren’t placeable,
the Medic, Scorch and Morale Boost abilities don’t exist either.
and leader cards don’t have their abilities and can’t be clicked.
You can also place all unit and hero cards correctly and their lines
are correctly placed.`;return{c(){e=m("h1"),e.textContent=i,n=g(),a=m("p"),a.textContent=d},l(t){e=c(t,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(e)!=="svelte-kj9duf"&&(e.textContent=i),n=v(t),a=c(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(a)!=="svelte-ql76ya"&&(a.textContent=d)},m(t,o){s(t,e,o),s(t,n,o),s(t,a,o)},p:l,i:l,o:l,d(t){t&&(r(e),r(n),r(a))}}}const x={title:"Devblog 2",date:"2025-05-07"},{title:C,date:k}=x;class H extends u{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,null,w,f,{})}}export{H as default,x as metadata};
